# Ex5_Diagnostics_of_debugging_algorithms

This programming exercise was done as part of Coursera's Machine Learning Course (Stanford University), taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.

* Implemented regularized linear regression to predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir
* Used the model to study diagnostics of debugging learning algorithms and examined the effects of bias vs variance
